      <h3>Tracelab: Software Traceability Instrumentation</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="border"><strong><i>Project Description.</i></strong> 
		  TraceLab is a research-based framework that is intended to
        facilitate innovation, creativity, and reproducability of research
        projects. It is used as an experimental environment to enable
        researchers to reproduce state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore,
        they are designed to improve software traceability solutions across
        various software engineering tasks. Such approaches can also be
        supported through visual modeling environment using a library of
        reusable and user-defined set of components. Overall, TraceLab
        provides easy access to recent techniques so that other researchers
        can modify and improve. For the state-of-the-art to
        advance, it is essential that current techniques be reproducable.</p>

		<em><strong>TraceLab Project-1.</strong></em> User stories are 
	    short descriptions of software features told from the user 
	    perspective. In general, a user story consists of a role, 
		function, and rationale, which is expressed as: <em>As a 
		&lt;role&gt;, I want to &lt;function&gt; so that I can &lt;rationale&gt;.</em> 
		In the work published at ICSE'2017, we presented a technique
        that aims to generate user stories from the recorded transcripts
        of conversations between customers and developers. The input
        to this approach is a plain transcript of customer and developer
        conversations. The output to this approach is a list of 'speech
        turns' in the conversation that include role, function, and
        rationale data (a speech turn is a section of speech by one
        member of the conversation, during which others are quiet).
        The automatic generation of extractive summaries for user
        stories is a new research area, and working implementations
        are rare. This artifact is a set of reproducible TraceLab
        components that implement our technique. The benefit to using
        TraceLab components is that they are not only reusable
        but relatively easy to modify, so that future researchers can
        build improvements over our approach.</p>

		<em><strong>TraceLab Project-2.</strong></em> 'Speech Acts' are generally
        expressed as verbal actions to achieve a specific task. A typical
        expression of speech act is the following example: <em>I've just
        made some tea</em>. As a result, the speech does more than
        stating a fact &#8212; it has a <strong>consequence</strong>. This
        example may imply <em>to invite</em> or <em>to offer</em>.
        In recent work published at FSE'2018, we presented a multi-label
        classification technique that aims at detecting speech act types
        from written question and/or answer conversations between
        programmers. In our approach, a 'virtual assistant' receives as an
        input a message, and outputs the same message classified into one 
        of several categories. A virtual assistant is a system that emulates 
        the answers that programmers would give in a conversation. 
        Virtual assistants for software engineering have not
        yet scratched the base to construct models of programmer
        conversations, and working implementations of this kind are
        necessary to push forward the software engineering research
        community. We reproduce our technique by providing an artifact that
        consists of a set of TraceLab components. TraceLab components are
        beneficial for two reasons. These components are reusable and fairly
        easy to modify and the researchers can extend them for further
        improvements.</p>
