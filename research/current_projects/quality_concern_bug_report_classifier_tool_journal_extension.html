      <h3>A Multi-Model Framework for Semantically Enhancing Detection of Quality Bugs</h3>
      <br>
      <p class="border"><strong><i>Project Description.</i></strong> 
		  Maintaining and delivering a high-quality software system is a
        delicate process. One way to ensure that a software system achieves
        the desired quality is to systematically monitor and timely address 
		  <em>quality-related concerns</em>. Quality concerns, such as
        reliability, usability, performance, and maintainability, among
        others, can have a broad impact in ensuring that a system remains
        consistently reliant and available at all times. In contrast, when
        such concerns are overlooked, become difficult to navigate, or
        maintain, system-wide failures could emerge. Typically, these
        failures can chiefly hinder the core functionality of the system and
        produce a large amount of <em>quality bug reports</em>. For the
        developers, manually examining these high-impacted quality-related
        bug reports in open-source issue tracking systems can become a
        prohibitively expensive and impractical task to deliver. Partly,
        because such bugs often require expert knowledge to address them.
        The more perplexing concern is the fact that these bugs are deemed
        difficult to detect due to their intertwined relationship with
        functional bugs. Even worse, there are instances when several types
        of quality concerns are intertwined among each other. Seemingly,
        these scenarios make quality concerns non-discernible. To address this
        problem, we implemented a multi-model framework (BugReportSoftQualDetector) 
		to automatically detect quality-related
        content in bug report descriptions. Specifically, we leveraged a
        weighted combination of <em>semantics</em>, <em>lexical</em>, 
		and <em>shallow</em> features in conjunction with the<em> Random Forest</em> 
		model to detect six most emerging quality concerns present in bug
        report descriptions. Our results indicate that our approach
        outperformed both state-of-the-art approaches, one that leveraged
        lexical features and the other that leveraged shallow features. To
        assess our approach, we examined six diverse open-source domains
        hosted from two issue-tracking systems such as Jira and Bugzilla.
        Through a grounded theory approach, we created a catalog of rules
        and employed ISO 25010 taxonomy and the FURPS taxonomy to categorize
        bug reports into six quality types of: performance, maintainability,
        reliability, portability, usability, and security. We then employed
        content analysisÂ  to manually label 5,400 bug reports. Finally, we
        included a case study for tracing and visually mapping quality
        concerns into the codebase.</p>
